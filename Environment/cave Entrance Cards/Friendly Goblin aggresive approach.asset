  gameText: You walk into a small room dug into the cave with your sword at the ready.
    A small goblin sitting on his bed spots you. He screams and jumps out of bed.
    "Come into my home with your weapon drawn! You'll regret this!". The goblin runs
    behind his bed and returns wearing an oversized helmet and a sword obviously
    meant for someone twice his size, he is looking a little pathetic. "Nobody ambushes
    Grundar! En garde!"
  option1: En garde!
  option2: Sheath your weapon and try to calm the little creature.
