  gameText: The goblin did not like that. "Come into my home with your weapon drawn!
    Even after being offered tea! You'll regret this!". The goblin runs behind his
    bed and returns wearing an oversized helmet and a sword obviously meant for someone
    twice his size, he is looking a little pathetic. "Nobody ambushes Grundar! En
    garde!"
